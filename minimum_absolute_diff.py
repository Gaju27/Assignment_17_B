# Find a pair with sum N having minimum absolute difference
#
# Given an integerN, the task is to  find a distinct pair of X and Y such that X + Y = N and abs(X â€“ Y) is minimum.
#

# Python3 program to implement
# the above approach

# Function to find the value of X and Y
# having minimum value of abs(X - Y)
