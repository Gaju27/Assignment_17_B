# Maximum array elements that can be removed along with its adjacent values to empty given array

# Given an array arr[] of size N. In each operation, pick an array element X and remove all array elements in the range [X â€“ 1, X + 1].
# The task is to find the maximum number of steps required such that no coins left in the array.

# # Python3 program to implement
# the above approach

# Function to find maximum steps to
# remove all coins from the arr[]
